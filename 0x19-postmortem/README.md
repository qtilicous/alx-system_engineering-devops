0x19. Postmortem

**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration:** The outage occurred on March 8th, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 1:30 PM (GMT).
- **Impact:** The outage affected the main web application service, resulting in a 30% reduction in user activity and intermittent access issues for all users.
- **Root Cause:** The root cause of the outage was traced back to a database connection pool exhaustion due to a spike in concurrent user requests.

**Timeline:**

- **10:00 AM:** The issue was detected through monitoring alerts indicating increased latency and error rates in the web application.
- **10:10 AM:** Engineers initiated investigation, suspecting database connectivity issues.
- **10:30 AM:** Initial investigation focused on database performance and network connectivity.
- **11:00 AM:** Despite optimizing database configurations, the issue persisted.
- **11:30 AM:** Escalation to senior engineering team and database administrators.
- **12:00 PM:** Further analysis revealed a high number of open database connections, leading to the hypothesis of connection pool exhaustion.
- **12:30 PM:** Connection pool settings were adjusted to accommodate higher traffic.
- **1:30 PM:** The issue was resolved as the connection pool adjustments took effect, restoring normal service.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

- **Root Cause:** The root cause of the issue was an unexpected surge in concurrent user requests, which led to the exhaustion of available database connections in the connection pool.
- **Resolution:** The issue was resolved by adjusting the connection pool settings to increase the maximum number of allowed connections, effectively accommodating the increased user load without causing connection failures.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement automatic scaling mechanisms to dynamically adjust connection pool settings based on traffic patterns.
  - Enhance monitoring systems to provide early detection of connection pool exhaustion and other performance bottlenecks.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Implement automated load testing to simulate high traffic scenarios and validate the scalability of the system.
  - Conduct a comprehensive review of application code to identify and optimize database query performance.
  - Develop and document standard procedures for handling database connection issues during peak traffic periods.

In conclusion, the outage on March 8th, 2024, was attributed to database connection pool exhaustion caused by a sudden increase in user activity. Through collaborative investigation and timely intervention, the issue was successfully resolved, and measures have been proposed to prevent similar incidents in the future.
